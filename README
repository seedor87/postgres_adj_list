This is some sample code that is to be kept for future reference.
The .py file is to be run. It generates the out.dot file (to be used with a program like graphviz) as well as prints the list of insertion queries that store the graph
The .sql file contains the setup to make the table, some demo insertion queries and all of the work that allows the queries to work on the table task
Each .sql function has a explanation comment before it as well as some demo code after it with a comment that explains some use cases for that function.
